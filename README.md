## üìù Description
This is a single-page application with a quiz for Software Engineers.  When the page opens, 20 questions will be generated.  The user must then answer the questions and hit the submit button at the bottom of the page to see their score.  The user will then have the chance to view the answers to the quiz and generate a new quiz.

While studying at General Assembly, I created this bonus project by myself to learn TypeScript with the other technologies taught in the course.

Due to the fact that I did not use a bundler (I created this Express app from scratch) the use of the dotenv library becomes quite complex with TypeScript.  After speaking with a couple of my instructors, it was determined that this project could be run with the set up below.
